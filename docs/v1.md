# A modest MVP

## SQL stash => Reusable tools...?
We were frustrated about being the gatekeepers, the fix-it guys, the human run buttons ðŸ¤–. And our first idea was to take all those ad-hoc SQL queries that lived in text files on our computers and to turn them into reusable tools for everyone at our company.

## Design goals
1. Desired workflow: write SQL, get a new tool instantaneously
2. Out-of-the-box guardrails and RBAC
3. History of everything that happened

## A simple workflow
We found that we could build this system pretty easily if we just wrote stored procs.

We thought this was neat because it was simpler than the old way of doing things, where we would either 1) turn into the gatekeeper for urgent data requests, 2) build a frontend to expose the query. 

## Don't you still have to write the SQL?
Yes. This system saved us from repeatedly running things for other people and repeatedly building simple UI.
