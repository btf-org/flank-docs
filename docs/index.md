# Flank

Flank is a really simple and really scalable way to build business software — dashboards, internal tools, simple automations, BI, admin panels.

[It is motivated by our own experience](motivations.md), where, as engineers, we were relied upon to urgently fix things all the time.

It might sound like we’re boiling the ocean, but Flank is a small and simple tool. We've really focused on three areas:

- Speed
- Simplicity
- Scaling
