# Flank

Flank is a really **simple** and really **scalable** way to build business software — dashboards, internal tools, simple automations, BI, admin panels.

It might sound like we’re boiling the ocean, but Flank is a small and simple tool. It's a wrapper around your backend services, like APIs, cloud functions, and stored procedures. It allows engineers to get repeated use out of "one-off" fixes. It allows teams to release tools without over-investing in UI. 

Flank provides three key utilities to engineers:
1. Hosting
2. Auth and RBAC
3. Webpage generation
