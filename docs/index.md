# **flank**

The idea of Flank is that you solve business problems by [just writing code](just-write-code.md). Flank erases the cognitive burden of infrastructure, cloud services, docker, UI/UX, orchestration, permissioning, analytics, audit trails, and compliance.

Flank is running in 4 companies. We've been happy with [the results so far](results.md).
