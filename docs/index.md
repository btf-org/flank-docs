# **flank**

Flank allows engineers to solve business problems by [just writing code](just-write-code.md).

It is cloud platform + web app that saves engineers from having to think about _everything else_: ~~what programming language to use, where your code is running, orchestration, a website with logins, user guardrails, basic UI components, audit trails, connecting API calls, building frontends, analytics, compliance.~~

Flank is running in 4 companies. We've been happy with [the results so far](results.md).
