# Goals and Core Concepts

## Don't overinvest in UI

## Get leverage out of one-off fixes

With those goals in mind, we set out to build a dashboard / app / tool builder thatâ€¦

1. Had an upfront cost close to 0
2. Covered 90% of our internal tooling / dashboarding / admin panel use cases
3. Provided out-of-the-box guardrails and access control
4. Allowed the engineers to quickly figure out who did what whenever things did go wrong
