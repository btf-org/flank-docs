4. Deployment & Operations
5. Maintencance and Scaling

## Planning and Design
### Usage Tracker across tools
Flank tracks the usage of tools through a couple of key metrics like “runs over time”, “number of unique users”, etc. These help you figure out lots of next decisions like:
 - Tools that are used a lot, so they could benefit from a custom UI
 - Tools that could benefit other parts of the org

### Delay Front-end Design
With Flank, there’s no need to design a UI when first building a tool. Instead focus on getting the business logic right and work with your users to see how they interact with the tool. Given that feedback, you (or your designers) will be able to create a better custom Ui after some initial usage. This enables you to build the best UI for tools that deserve it and stops over designing for tools which don’t need it.

## Coding and Development
### Instant UI development
You write the backend business logic, Flank builds the Ui and creates a webpage for your teammates or users to access it.


## Testing and Quality Assurance
### Bug reporting system
Flank incorporates an intuitive bug reporting system that facilitates the identification, tracking, and resolution of software bugs. This system helps maintain high-quality standards by ensuring that issues are promptly addressed and resolved, enhancing the reliability of your tools.

## Deployment and Operations
### Flank handles the hosting for the UI
Flank simplifies the deployment process by managing the hosting of your tool's UI. This eliminates the need for complex server setups and reduces the operational burden on your team.

### Built-in Auth Management System
Flank comes equipped with a built-in authentication management system that secures access to your tools. It manages user identities and ensures that only authorized users can access specific functions, enhancing security and compliance.

### Automatic updates for tools
Flank supports the continuous improvement of tools by automatically applying updates. This feature ensures that all tools remain current with the latest features and security patches, minimizing downtime and maintaining operational efficiency.



## Maintenance and Scaling
### File & Folder Management System
Flank includes a comprehensive file and folder management system that organizes and secures digital assets. This system supports efficient scaling by ensuring that resources are well-managed and accessible as your tools grow.

### Templated UI for easy re-use
Flank offers a range of UI templates that can be easily customized and reused across different tools. This not only speeds up the development process but also ensures a consistent user experience across your toolkit.
