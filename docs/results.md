# Results so far

Flank is running in 4 companies: 

- 1-person data science operation
- 10-person SaaS company
- 60-person SaaS company
- 350-person marketplace (with a warehouse)

In a way, we've been surprised -- even at different sizes/stages, the effect of Flank has been the same:

**Eliminating tools, meetings, and messages.**

At any 1-person company, it's all about the tools. In this case, the Data Scientist had to dive into AWS whenever an R script needs to be run in parallel, or on a schedule, or on a machine with more memory.

With Flank, he just writes R scripts. No AWS.

**Eliminating tools, meetings, and messages.**

At a 10-person company, the Sales team needed to get up-to-the-minute predictions from a model. Before, they had a React app built by consultants. The consultants were slow, so their in-house Data Engineer had to manually service a lot of these data requests.

With Flank, their Data Engineer can deliver reusable tools without using the consultants.

**Eliminating tools, meetings, and messages.**

At a 60-person company, the Customer Service team couldn't wait for apps to get built, so they would resolve problems by manually triggering API calls in Postman. They were working in JSON, making errors, Slacking engineers for API keys... it was a mess.

With Flank, they can quickly wire together API calls to make safe, reusable apps. They don't have to think about API keys or JSON or HTTP methods.

**Eliminating tools, meetings, and messages.**

At a 350-person startup, the communication overhead is real. With this company (marketplace, with warehouse) every little feature required a meeting between a PM, a designer, a React Developer, a Database Engineer, and an API engineer. Also, their Database Engineers were swamped with urgent requests from the Operations team.

With Flank, they ship like they're a small startup again. Their Database Engineer can deliver reusable tools as quickly as he can service ad-hoc requests. He can schedule jobs and set up alerts without any Azure help. And he can iterate with users directly, without a PM having to intermediate.
