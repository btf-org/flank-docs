# Results so far

Flank is running in 4 companies: 

- 1-person data science operation
- 10-person SaaS company
- 60-person SaaS company
- 350-person marketplace (with a warehouse)

We've been pleasantly surprised with the results so far.

One thing that has been surprising is that, even in very different-looking companies at very different stages, Flank's effect has been felt in the same way:

**Eliminating tools, meetings, and messages.**

At a 1-person data science operation, the data scientist had to dive into AWS whenever an R script needs to be run in parallel, or on a schedule, or on a machine with more memory.

With Flank, he just writes R scripts. No AWS.

**Eliminating tools, meetings, and messages.**

At a 10-person SaaS company, the Sales team needed to get up-to-the-minute predictions from a model. Before, they had a custom React app to serve up this data. The React app was built by consultants. It was a slow feedback loop, so the Data Engineer had to manually service a lot of these data requests.

With Flank, their in-house Data Engineer can deliver reusable tools without having to meet with the consultants.

**Eliminating tools, meetings, and messages.**

At a 60-person SaaS company, the Customer Service team couldn't wait for apps to get built, so they resolved problems by manually triggering API calls in Postman. They were working in JSON, making errors, Slacking engineers for API keys... it was a mess.

With Flank, they can quickly wire together API calls to make safe, reusable apps, where users don't have to think about API keys or JSON or HTTP methods.

**Eliminating tools, meetings, and messages.**

At a 350-person marketplace (with a warehouse), every little feature now requires a meeting between a PM, a designer, a React developer, a database engineer, and an API engineer. Also, their database engineers are swamped with urgent requests from the Operations team.

With Flank, they can ship like a tiny startup again. Their database engineer can deliver reusable tools without a designer and frontend developer. He can schedule jobs and set up alerts without any Azure help. He can iterate with users without a PM intermediating.
