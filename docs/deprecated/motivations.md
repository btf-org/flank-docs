# Persistent grumblings

## Urgent requests

*AKA burning TF out as the fix-it guy.*

We all worked at companies that relied on the engineers to fix things. A quick query. Kicking off a job that failed. Changing a value in the database.

Dealing with these requests sucked 🤮, but it was better than the alternatives. Giving people access to the database could create WAY more work. And building them an app to do the job wasn’t worth it, especially for just that once.

But it always starts with just that one time… at what point do you build an app? The third time? The tenth time?

We wondered to ourselves, *“Is there a way we could get leverage on these so-called 'one-off' fixes?”*

## Requirements change

*AKA watching the tools we just built get thrown away because the boss changed his mind*

When we did commit to building tools, half the time they’d get thrown away. Either the spec made no sense, or the business focus would change, or someone from another department would step into a meeting and say, “We’ve already got something that solves this problem.” 😡

We wondered to ourselves, *“Is there a way to prototype features more quickly? To build less while still learning the same amount?”*

## The Hydra 

*AKA how could a user possibly thought to do that?*

We built tools to take ourselves out of the loop, but then… The tools would go down. Our users would punch a string into a field that required an int. The backend API would change and the frontend would be out of date. Everything we built would somehow generate **more** work, not less. 😩

We wondered to ourselves, *“Could we templatize guardrails in some way? Could we make it easier to get visibility into the system?”*
