# Quick Start

In this example, we'll create a dashboard and a tool using Flank. To simulate a real backend, we're going to first create a simple API. The whole process should only take about 5 minutes.



1. [Download](https://flank-quickstart-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/google-colab/flank_quickstart_colab.ipynb) a Jupyter Notebook with all the code.
2. Upload it to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/){:target="_blank"}. See below. 
3. Follow instructions in notebook.
