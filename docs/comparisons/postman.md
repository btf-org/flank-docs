# Postman

Postmand and Flank are similar in that they both sit on top existing code/services and don't house any app logic themselves.

Postman is a great tool to have in your back pocket if you're **building and testing APIs**.

Flank is a tool to run an API endpoint **once it's built.** It's used to **safely expose functionality** to business people.

| Used by              | Engineers and Business People                                                                                   | Just Engineers                                         |
| Problem it solves    | It's difficult to quickly and safely expose API functionality to business people                                | Difficult to develop and test an API in the terminal   |
| Best for             | Building business software                                                                                      | Developing and testing APIs                            |
| Typical workflow     | Deploy an API endpoint, Flank generates a web page for it, can be combined with other endpoints to create tools | Import an API spec, make API requests                  |
| Technically speaking | A wrapper around your API that provides autogenerated UI                                                        | Thin client for making HTTP requests                   |
| Key simplification   | 90% of internal apps are just input boxes and buttons that are wired up to API endpoints                        | Everything you do with \`curl\` is much easier in a UI |
| Key difference       | Intended to be used by business people                                                                          | Many more testing and debugging utilities              |
| Throwback analogy    | An API => HTML compiler                                                                                         | Interface for \`curl\`                                 |
