# Postman

Postman is a tool for engineering teams to develop and test APIs. It's similar to Flank in that they both sit on top existing code/services and don't house any app logic themselves.

The big difference is that Postman is intended to be used by engineers. With Flank, the goal is for the engineer to use the app *as little as possible*. Flank is just a way to get functionality in the hands of a business user.

Postman is a good tool. Recommend.

| Used by              | Engineers and Business People                                                                                   | Just Engineers                                         |
| Problem it solves    | It's difficult to quickly and safely expose API functionality to business people                                | Difficult to develop and test an API in the terminal   |
| Best for             | Building business software                                                                                      | Developing and testing APIs                            |
| Typical workflow     | Deploy an API endpoint, Flank generates a web page for it, can be combined with other endpoints to create tools | Import an API spec, make API requests                  |
| Technically speaking | A wrapper around your API that provides autogenerated UI                                                        | Thin client for making HTTP requests                   |
| Key simplification   | 90% of internal apps are just input boxes and buttons that are wired up to API endpoints                        | Everything you do with \`curl\` is much easier in a UI |
| Key difference       | Intended to be used by business people                                                                          | Many more testing and debugging utilities              |
| Throwback analogy    | An API => HTML compiler                                                                                         | Interface for \`curl\`                                 |
