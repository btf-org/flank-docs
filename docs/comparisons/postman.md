# Postman

## The problem that **\_\_** solves:

**Postman**

- It’s difficult to develop and test an API using nothing more than `curl`

**Flank**

- It’s difficult to safely expose an API endpoint to a non-engineer

## Use **\_\_** if…

**Postman**

- You have to debug a 3rd party API
- You want to create machine-readable documentation for your API
- You need an interface for saving and quickly accessing API calls for the purpose of testing

**Flank**

- You need to expose API endpoints to non-engineers

## How does **\_** work?

**Postman**

- Barebones client/UI that is tailor-made for making HTTP requests
- Classic use case: Import an API spec and configure a library of endpoints for testing

**Flank**

- Simple interface for making requests, with a backend that tracks who ran what, when they ran it, etc.
- Classic use case: Point Flank at your API, share an endpoint with a non-engineer teammate for them to run on their own

## Differentiated Features

**Postman**

- Generate API documentation
- Automated testing
- Analyzing headers of request and response

**Flank**

- Interface that anyone can use
- Input fields for various data types (dates, dropdowns, etc.)
- Searchable history

## Summary

- **Postman** is a tool for engineering teams to develop and test APIs, where all the users are engineers
- **Flank** is a tool for engineers to take themselves out of the loop, to share access with non-engineers
