# Comparisons
Flank is like a **barebones Retool**, or **Postman with guardrails**, or **SwaggerUI on steroids**.


| Comparison           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Retool               | Flank is laser-focused on making one Retool use case as smooth as possible, which is: creating some input fields, wiring them up to a SPROC/API endpoint, displaying the results in a table, then attaching buttons to each row. Flank does all that automatically, but that's all it does. Retool offers UI/UX flexibility that is much closer to a React app. Flank is closer to Postman.                                                       |

| Budibase             | See Retool                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Slackbots            | Flank and Slackbots are kindred spirits. The difference comes down to UI + RBAC. Flank has input fields with guardrails, and it show the results in tables. Also, everything is permissioned at the function level. Slackbots are much better-suited for any problems that fit into a messaging paradigm.                                              |
| React & SPAs         | With Flank you get 1) hosting, 2) SSO, 3) RBAC, 4) autogenerated input fields, and 5) audit trails. But there's zero customization of the UI (aside from adding guardrails). If you need to build 50 pages that look like a Google Form, use Flank for that.                                                                                               |
| Rails & SSRs         | See React                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Postman              | Imagine Postman, but with an interface for a business person. Inputs with guardrails. That's Flank. Flank can tackle more complex apps use cases too... You can put buttons on tables by wiring up the output of one function to the input of another.                                                                                                                                 |
| SwaggerUI            | Flank is basically SwaggerUI, but for engineers to collaborate with business people. It has RBAC and a user-friendly interface. Also it does things like storing run results so that users can download them. And Flank can tackle more complex use cases as well. Like you can put buttons on tables by wiring up the output of one function to the input of another.                                      |
| PopSQL               | Flank is also organized around the idea of a library of queries. But Flank is not a SQL IDE. It is laser-focused on one part of the development process, which is safely exposing a written SPROC to a non-engineer. It can also do more "app-ish" things, like feeding the outputs into the inputs of another (i.e. tables with buttons on the rows). |
| Snowflake Worksheets | Flank is designed for business people. They don't see any raw SQL when they trigger a SPROC/API endpoint. It's just simple UI with guardrails.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Tableau              | Flank is for urgent, straight-to-Excel reports, not pretty visualizations. Also, Flank can trigger SPROCs/API endpoints that write back to the database.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Streamlit            | Flank doesn't do interactive data visualization stuff. It is simply a tool for turning a SPROC/API endpoint into a webpage with guardrails. It's agnostic to how the function is written as long as it's callable over the internet.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Zapier               | Flank is for use cases where a human needs to go click a button.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| dbt                  | Flank has a little pipelineing/orchestration ability, but, really, it's designed for situations where a human needs to go click a button to get some data or update some data or re-run something.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Pipedream            | Flank is for use cases where a human needs to go click a button.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
