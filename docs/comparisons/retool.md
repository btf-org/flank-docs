# Retool, PowerApps

Retool and Flank are both general purpose tools for building business software.

Retool is great for **rich UIs** and **interactive apps**. We introduced Retool at past jobs, and we highly recommend it. (Haven't used PowerApps, can't recommend it...)

Flank is great for building **lots of small tools**, where the UI just needs to look as good as a Google Form.

| Used by              | Engineers (to build) and business people (end users)                         | Ditto                                                                                                            |
| Best for             | Releasing functionality as quickly as possible, where UI doesn't matter much | Building internal websites with rich UIs                                                                         |
| Typical workflow     | Deploy backend code, Flank generates a web page for it, share with teammmate | Design a website by dragging and dropping a library of components onto the screen, then wire it up to SQL and JS |
| Technically speaking | Wrapper around backend services that provides an API and autogenerated UI    | Drag-and-rdop WYSIWYG website builder, with code editor and execution built in                                   |
| Key simplification   | 90% of features don't need a designed interface                              | Wiring up components is easier in a drag-and-drop editor than in pure HTML                                       |
| Key difference       | You write and deploy your code on your terms. Flank merely wraps it.         | Your code is written, stored, and executed in Retool's platform.                                                 |
| Throwback analogy    | Visual Unix pipes                                                            | MS Access for the web                                                                                            |
