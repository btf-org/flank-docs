# Retool

Retool and Flank are both general purpose tools for building business software.

If you need to build rich UIs and interactive apps, use Retool. We introduced Retool at past jobs, and we highly recommend it. (Haven't used PowerApps, can't recommend it...)

Flank, on the other hand, is useful for turning ad-hoc queries and API endpoints into zero-maintenance tools.

| Used by              | Engineers (to build) and business people (end users)                         | Ditto                                                                                                            |
| Best for             | Releasing functionality as quickly as possible, where UI doesn't matter much | Building internal websites with rich UIs                                                                         |
| Typical workflow     | Deploy backend code, Flank generates a web page for it, share with teammmate | Design a website by dragging and dropping a library of components onto the screen, then wire it up to SQL and JS |
| Technically speaking | Wrapper around backend services that provides an API and autogenerated UI    | Drag-and-rdop WYSIWYG website builder, with code editor and execution built in                                   |
| Key simplification   | 90% of features don't need a designed interface                              | Wiring up components is easier in a drag-and-drop editor than in pure HTML                                       |
| Key difference       | You write and deploy your code on your terms. Flank merely wraps it.         | Your code is written, stored, and executed in Retool's platform.                                                 |
| Throwback analogy    | Visual Unix pipes                                                            | MS Access for the web                                                                                            |
