# Just write code

The idea of Flank is that you solve business problems by **_just writing code_**. Flank erases the cognitive burden of infrastructure, cloud services, docker, UI/UX, orchestration, permissioning, analytics, audit trails, and compliance.

To get started is as simple as pushing a script to your GitHub repository. That's it. You **_just write code_**.

That’s not to say that Flank only works with GitHub. It integrates with REST APIs, databases, and cloud functions. Flank doesn’t care where the code runs. The important thing is that you **_just write code_**. 

Once Flank has discovered your script, you can set it up to run on a schedule. You don’t have to futz around with any cloud services. You **_just write code_**.

You can also build apps for non-technical teammates. Flank has an opinionated UI/UX that requires no frontend work. Backend devs can ship whole features themselves, by **_just writing code_**.

Flank lays the groundwork for graceful scaling. Developers don’t have to spend time on permissioning, UI debt, compliance, logging, or analytics. They **_just write code_**.
