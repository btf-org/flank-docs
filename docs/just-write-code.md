# Just write code

**Just write code.**

That is the whole idea of Flank.

We've lost the ability to solve simple business problems. Too many tools. Too much specialization. You shouldn't have to sit in a meeting with 6 people to schedule a task.

**Just write code.**

To get started, push a script to GitHub. That's it. It'll show up in the Flank web app.

**Just write code.**

You could also wire up an API or a database. Anything that can be containerized or run over the internet. Flank doesn't care whether the code runs on your infrastructure or ours.

**Just write code.**

Once Flank has discovered your script, you can set it up to run on a schedule. No need to go into a cloud portal or configure an orchestration tool.

**Just write code.**

You shouldn't have to always be on call. Because we know that script will need to get re-run manually.  And it's crazy to build a whole website with logins and guardrails.

**Just write code.**

Flank automatically creates UI around your script. Datepickers for input, tables for output. It's intuitive for users, and incredibly fast for developers.

**Just write code.**

Sometimes your teammate will fat-finger an input. It's easy to drill into what happened. You don't have to build audit trails for tracking down errors.

**Just write code.**

You can even set up automated alerts by piping the output into another task (e.g. PagerDuty API call). You don't have to think about how to connect a script and an API call.

**Just write code.**

The ability to connect two tasks is quite powerful. _Get a list of X_ and then _take some action on X_ is a common pattern. In this way, Flank lets you build apps for non-technical teammates.

**Just write code.**

Once people are using Flank, the product team will want insights into user behavior. Flank provides analytics on who does what,  when. You shouldn't have to instrument everything.

**Just write code.**

As your company grows, your engineering manager will want to stay compliant. Flank makes it easy to configure that. 

**Just write code.**

There is no DDL or YAML or learning curve for any of this. You (the engineer) are the scarce resource. You shouldn't have to spent time learning yet another tool.

**Just write code.**

Flank houses no "application logic" at all. No loops, no conditionals. There's no lock-in because you control your code. You can even host Flank yourself.

**Just write code. âœŒ**

Flank is all about what you **don't** have to think about: ~~what programming language to use, where your code is running, orchestration, a website with logins, user guardrails, basic UI components, audit trails, connecting API calls, building frontends, analytics, compliance.~~
