# Miscellaneous

## Inspirations

### Unix

One of our key features is the ability to take the output of one command and to pass it into the input of another command. That idea came from Unix pipes. We’re just doing it with APIs and stored procs in a web app, rather than text processing programs in the shell.

### REPLs and Jupyter Notebooks

The entire premise of Flank is that software will be built more quickly when it is built in smaller units. REPLs and Jupyter Notebooks are the tools that made us feel this, in our bones.

### Notion

Our goal is to take the upfront cost of building an app to near zero, and that requires an obsessive focus on little micro-frictions. Notion addresses nearly invisible micro-frictions really well, so much so that almost nobody can describe what they like about it.
